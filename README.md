Life-Files

This repository is a governed container for a personal document corpus used in agentic analysis.

Authoritative scope:
- All analyzable materials reside under /corpus
- No files outside /corpus are in analytical scope

Agents and tools must:
- Treat commit history as the authoritative temporal signal
- Defer all corpus rules to corpus/README.md
- Make no inferences about intent, identity, or meaning outside governed prompts

This README exists for orientation only.
